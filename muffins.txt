Ingredients
2 cups flour
1 tbsp bakingpowder
0.5 tsp salt
2 tbsp sugar
1 whole egg
1 cup milk
0.25 cup butter

Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease muffin pan with butter or with nonstick baking spray. Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Mix egg, milk, and melted butter. Add wet mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until the ingredients are combined. The mixture should not be perfectly smooth. Spoon the mixture into the muffin pan, filling each cup about two thirds full. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool slightly before eating and cool completely before storing. 

Enjoy!
